      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am currently a student at Cerritos College pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
        My academic goal is to transfer to a top-tier university such as UC Davis or UC Berkeley,
        where I hope to continue building on the strong foundation I’ve developed at Cerritos.
        To support this goal, I’ve enrolled in a variety of challenging courses that align with my
        major and long-term aspirations in the tech field.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the key classes I’ve completed include
        <strong>CIS 231</strong> (Advanced C++ Programming),
        <strong>CIS 103</strong> (Introduction to Programming),
        <strong>CIS 180</strong> (Assembly Language Programming),
        and <strong>CIS 280X</strong> (Special Topics in Computer Science).
        Each of these courses has helped me build practical skills in coding,
        problem-solving, and system-level thinking.
        In addition, I’ve taken <strong>Math 170</strong> (Calculus I)
        and <strong>Math 190</strong> (Calculus II),
        which have strengthened my analytical and mathematical reasoning—
        skills that are essential in computer science.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through these courses, I’ve gained hands-on experience working on software projects,
        writing clean and efficient code, and understanding how low-level operations influence
        higher-level programming. My academic journey so far has reinforced my interest in fields
        such as software development, game design, and data science, and I’m excited to take the
        next step in my education at a four-year university.
